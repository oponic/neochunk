### Proof of Concept for a Chunk-based incremental Reality simulation
## How does it work?
It doesn't.
Most of the data has been pregenerated and is being reused.
AS of now.
I'm planning to fork this when enough progress has been made and implement it with Gemma or LLaMA-3.
# How do I try it?
Make sure you're running a Unix (BSD, macOS), Unix-like (Linux), or similar OS.
Executable files can be found in Releases.
